Smells of Testable Architecture

## Activity Mission

A testability smell is a symptom of a testing problem. We believe each of the smells listed below can be tamed by establishing a more testable architecture. This exercise aims to determine which testability smells impact your team and the extent of the impact on both the team as a whole and each of the individuals. The findings of this exercise will allow your team to make informed decisions about which testability smells to tackle.

## Session Objectives

* Understand the classification of each of the smells and how they interact
* Understand the impact of each of the smells on delivery of projects and products
* Recognise the smells as indicators of poor testability going forwards

## Method

* In groups of 5
* Introduce the four concepts of breaking down testability
* Associate each smell with a concept (or all of them)
* Assign an impact rating to each from 1 to 5
* Pick a high impact smell and describe why it shows a testable architecture problem

## Dependencies

* Smells on post it notes or cut outs
* Quadrants for each of the teams
