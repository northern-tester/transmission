# Activity Name

Build a testability canvas

## Activity Mission

In order to determine a way forward to improving testability, a holistic view of the architecture and its challenges needs to be drawn together. This should include many aspects of the system to prevent local optimisation.

## Session Objectives

* Understand the impact of adjacent teams on the testability of an architecture
* Understand the challenge of internal and external dependencies to the overall testability of an architecture
* Recognise common pain points in each interface and layer of the architecture
* Recommend remedial action in a time and effort sensitive manner

## Method

* In our groups of 5 again
* Using a handout with descriptions of adjacent teams, review the challenge of how other teams impact testability - do the target exercise
* Using a handout of dependent systems, including 3rd party services and internal systems, add to a risk matrix with downtime, recovery, mockability, documentation
* Using handouts of potential layered risks and remedies by effort.
* Create a Now Next Later strategy for improvement.

## To create

* Handout - describing adjacent teams
* Handout - describing third parties
* Handout - layered risks and interfaces
* Handout - small, medium, large remedies for decomposability, simplicity, observability and controllability problems.
* Slides for flow purposes
