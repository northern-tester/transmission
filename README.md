# Revealing Architectural Testability

## Description of Workshop

A question I often ask testers is 'can you draw me the architecture of the systems that you test?' The answer is often *stares blankly.* I believe this is a core competency for an effective tester and the answer should be (more often than not) 'of course I can!'`

This workshop encourages testers to interrogate, evaluate and elucidate the architectures they test, with the end goal of providing analysis of risk and information to those who matter.

The workshop requires:
* A0 Paper or Large Writable Wall Spaces
* Post It Notes
* Your favourite pens
* Scales to about 2 teams per facilitator 
* About 4 people per team works well
* Effort
* Questions
* Within each Exercise Folder (apart from the Warm Up), there are Handouts and Solutions folders. Print the handouts, done give out the solutions. ;)

__Objectives for this workshop:__

* `Attendees can recognise and explain the load balancing, web, API, database and shared access networks architectural layers.`
* `Attendees will be able to sketch an architecture from a set of technical documentation and anecdotal sources.`
* `Attendees will be able to interrogate a mobile app to reveal its architecture.`
* `Attendees can identify key risk points within an architecture and build a context sensitive approach to testing.`

__Running Order__

`Please allow between 3 and 5 hours for this exercise, depending on:`
* `Knowledge of architecture concepts and terminology`
* `How well they know each other`

__About Me__

I'm a continuously learning tester with a penchant for getting involved in all aspects of developing people and products. I used to be a fully fledged consultant with The Test People, veteran of various engagements encompassing testing, performance engineering and automation. Now I'm in the start up world, heavily involved in mobile product development, from the ground up. I also speak, coach and contribute to the local tech community in Leeds. I'm quite busy but always have time for a question, usually answered with another question. I have a blog at http://testingisbelieving.blogspot.co.uk/ too, oh and I tweet from @northern_tester. :-)
